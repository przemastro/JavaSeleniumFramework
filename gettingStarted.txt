Few steps need to be performed in order to use testlink with selenium:

1. Download and Install XAMPP (Can be replaced by standalone installation of Apache, PHP, MySql)
2. Download latest Testlink http://testlink.org/ and Extract to xampp\htdocs. I use testlink-1.9.14.
3. On windows correct linux based paths: $g_repositoryPath and $tlCfg->log_path in config.inc.php
4. Install TestLink locally (localhost/testlink/install) and create TestLink DB schema during installation
   with admin/admin credentials. I used everywhere login 'admin' with password 'admin', so I did not worry
   about authentication.
5. Import TestLink dump (mysql -u username -p database_name < file.sql), or simply run DB.sql query under testlink
   schema connection. You might need to change connection credential from standard root to admin/admin
6. Login @ localhost/testlink and see what shchema version testlink expects. I use 1.9.14. It is possible that you
   will use other version so update row in db_version table.
7. Run SQL query: grant all privileges on testlink.* to admin@localhost identified by 'admin';
   so selenium tests can run properly
8. In pom.xml set <suiteXmlFile> to proper xml file withs tests depending on what test suite you want to run


And last but not least please remember about using selenium, testng, chromedriver and Chrome binary compatible versions.

After tests are executed please navigate to http://localhost/testlink/index.php. Login and then go to 'Execute Tests' under
'Test Execution' and see tests results from last build
